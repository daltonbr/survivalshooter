### Version History

**v1.0** - 11/07/15
  * Finished the game as in the tutorial

**v1.1** - 12/07/15
(change to _CompletedAssets Folder)
	- ** Xbox Controller working **
	- Start Button pause and unpause (not controlling volumes yet)
	- RB Fires (default)
	- Right analog turn the player (need some alignment with the camera) (and hides the mouse cursor)

## Known Bugs and glitches
	- Sometimes the floor goes black (in editor mode at least) (solved)

### Ideas

* Minimum time between attacks
	- one player have a timer, but multiple enemies don't.
	- So it's a nice balance to have a "safety-timer" IN the player

* Xbox Controller support (done partially)
	- the right stick doesn't rotate the player (only the mouse)
	- set the Fire 1 to the R2 ?

* Start Menu

* High Score (persistent ?)

* Power UPs

* New weapons
	- Bombs ?
	- Damage Multiplier
	- Invencibility
	- Trail of fire

* Achievments (dreaming high huh :D )
